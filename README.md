# NN JackPack v2

![front of bag](media/v2/front1_ds.jpg)

The JackPack is a "Jack-of-all-trades" backpack. I designed it out of a need for a moderately sized, well-structured backpack I could use when traveling overnight or over a weekend. It isn't specifically ultralight, isn't specifically meant for backpacking, isn't specifically meant for day use, it's just a well-rounded backpack.
